# CodingNomads Ticketing

This app allows to build a queue for student questions during course times
in order to arrive at answers quicker and more efficiently.

As some queue said in a different time ages ago:
>First in, first out.

## Instructions

Instructors can use the queue to engage with students in the order that
their questions came up. Instructors and question owners can tick off a
question card after it has been answered.

The history of completed questions enables students to search for
recently answered questions. These cards include information on who
initially posted the question, as well as who has answered it.

Students can ask other students to help them with questions they have
received support on, or that they managed to answer by themselves.
